## 🗺 JOURNEY
### 📍Starting Point
I started learning coding since i was around 14-15 years old, my first lines of code were making a Discord bot, It felt good writing code and seeing it work for the first time so i continued...

### 🧭 Finding my passion
I got bored of making Discord bots since there is not alot to do and there is not enough customization to express my creativity so i went on making minecraft maps and learned how to use command blocks and made some custom maps later on I stumbled upon web development, i liked how i can make anything out of code and how i can make anything interactable and functional so i learned the basics: HTML, CSS, JS luckly i has experience with JS so it didn't take me that long to learn it
